Game developped during the MiG (Montpellier in Game)

This game was developped by a team of 9 persons within 60 hours : 3 artists, 3 developper, 2 game designers and 1 sound designer.

We had to integrate 5 random constraints in our game, ours was:
 - an inventory system,
 - some pathfinding,
 - using a microphone input,
 - an input controls at least two entities,
 - the camera can not move through the level.
 
We also took some inspiration from game such as ditto (http://www.nitrome.com/games/ditto/#.V6MXxOiLRhE), and for the nightmare version of the hero, limbo (http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/)
 
The code is (a bit) messy, this is due to several factor : this was one of the first serious game we designed and developped, we had to rush the game jam, and we used unity 4.5, which didn't has a great UI system (it came with Unity 4.6)

The game has recently been reworked a little to patch some bugs, all features remains the same as they were at the end of the GameJam. As said before, only bugs has been fixed, and even if the game needs some improvements on the difficulty scale and the ergonomy, it is and will not be done.

It is fully tested and functionnal with Unity 5.3.5f1, you can build and run it.

It is also both playable with the keyboard or an XBox controller.
